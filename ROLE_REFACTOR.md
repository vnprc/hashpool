# Role Refactor Status

## Overview
This document tracks the refactoring of communication between roles from Redis to direct SV2 TCP messaging.

## Completed Work

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: SV2 Message Types
- Created `protocols/v2/subprotocols/mint-quote/` with:
  - `MintQuoteRequest`: Pool ‚Üí Mint quote requests
  - `MintQuoteResponse`: Mint ‚Üí Pool quote responses  
  - `MintQuoteError`: Error responses
- Added message constants to `protocols/v2/const-sv2/`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Direct TCP Communication
- **Removed MintPoolMessageHub abstraction** - It was the wrong approach
- Implemented direct TCP connection between pool and mint
- Pool connects to mint on startup and maintains connection
- Messages flow directly via SV2 frames over TCP

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Redis Removal
- **Commit `0d1b4781`**: Completely removed Redis
- **Commit `0e018639`**: Removed keyset from all messages and structs
- Eliminated Redis-based quote creation logic
- All mint quote communication now uses TCP

## Current Issues

### üî¥ Critical: Keyset Distribution Broken
**Problem**: Translator/wallet cannot mint ecash tokens because it has no keyset information.

**Error**: `No keysets available in wallet - skipping mint attempt`

**Root Cause**: 
1. Redis previously distributed keyset from mint ‚Üí pool ‚Üí translator
2. In commit `0e018639`, keyset was removed from all SV2 messages
3. Redis was deleted in commit `0d1b4781`
4. No replacement mechanism was implemented

**Impact**: Complete failure of ecash token minting

## Required Fix: Keyset Distribution

### Option 1: Add Keyset to MintQuoteResponse (Recommended)
**Implementation**:
1. Extend `MintQuoteResponse` to include `keyset_id` field
2. Mint includes active keyset in every quote response
3. Pool forwards keyset to translator/wallet
4. Translator stores keyset for minting tokens

**Pros**:
- Simple, follows existing message flow
- No new message types needed
- Keyset updated with every quote

**Cons**:
- Slightly increases message size
- Redundant if keyset doesn't change often

### Option 2: New Keyset Broadcast Message
**Implementation**:
1. Create new `SetActiveKeyset` message type
2. Mint broadcasts when keyset changes
3. Pool forwards to all connected translators

**Pros**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Only sent when keyset changes

**Cons**:
- Requires new message type
- More complex implementation

### Option 3: HTTP API Query
**Implementation**:
1. Translator queries mint's HTTP endpoint for keysets
2. Uses existing CDK mint HTTP API

**Pros**:
- Uses existing infrastructure
- No SV2 protocol changes

**Cons**:
- Breaks the SV2-only communication model
- Requires translator to know mint's HTTP address

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Restore Keyset Communication
1. Add `keyset_id` field to `MintQuoteResponse`:
   - File: `protocols/v2/subprotocols/mint-quote/src/mint_quote_response.rs`
   - Add: `pub keyset_id: U256<'decoder>`

2. Include keyset in mint's response:
   - File: `roles/mint/src/lib/sv2_connection/quote_processing.rs`
   - Get active keyset from mint
   - Include in SV2 response

3. Forward keyset from pool to translator:
   - File: `roles/pool/src/lib/mining_pool/message_handler.rs`
   - Extract keyset from response
   - Forward to translator (needs investigation of how)

4. Store keyset in translator:
   - File: `roles/translator/src/lib/upstream_sv2/upstream.rs`
   - Receive keyset updates
   - Update wallet's keyset information

### Step 2: Test End-to-End
1. Verify mint includes keyset in responses
2. Confirm pool forwards keyset
3. Check translator receives and stores keyset
4. Test ecash token minting works

## Architecture Notes

### Current Flow
```
Pool ‚Üê‚Üí Mint (Direct TCP, SV2 protocol)
  ‚Üì
Translator (Needs keyset info)
```

### Missing Link
Pool receives `MintQuoteResponse` but has no way to communicate keyset to Translator.

### Investigation Needed
- How does Pool communicate with Translator?
- Is there an existing channel for Pool ‚Üí Translator messages?
- Should Translator connect directly to Mint for keyset info?

## Next Steps
1. Investigate Pool ‚Üí Translator communication mechanism
2. Implement chosen keyset distribution solution
3. Test complete flow from share submission to token minting
4. Update documentation with new architecture
