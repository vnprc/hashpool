This is a fork of the Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI). You can find the SRI readme [here](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/blob/main/README.md).

To run hashpool, first [install nix and devenv](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/).

Then run these commands from your hashpool directory:
```
devenv shell
devenv up
```

This project is very early. Bug reports and PRs are welcome!
